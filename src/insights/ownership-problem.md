title: "The Ownership Problem in Digital Programmes"

excerpt: "Digital initiatives fail not because of technology, but because nobody owns the outcome. Establishing clear accountability is the first step toward value realisation."

Every failed digital programme has something in common: nobody owned the outcome.

There was an IT team responsible for implementation. A vendor responsible for configuration. A steering committee responsible for governance. But no single person accountable for whether the investment delivered value.

## The Accountability Gap

When organisations procure enterprise platforms — whether PMIS, Digital Twin, or asset information systems — they typically assign ownership to whoever championed the business case or whoever's budget funded it. This makes sense administratively but fails strategically.

The champion moves on. The budget holder has other priorities. The platform becomes an orphan — technically supported but strategically adrift.

This is why so many digital investments generate activity without outcomes. Dashboards are built but not used. Data is collected but not acted upon. Platforms are implemented but not adopted.

## What Ownership Actually Means

True ownership of a digital product means accountability for:

- **Value realisation**: Is the investment delivering measurable business outcomes?
- **Adoption**: Are the intended users actually using the system?
- **Evolution**: Is the product evolving to meet changing business needs?
- **Governance**: Are the right decisions being made about scope, priority, and investment?

This isn't project management. It's product management — and it extends far beyond go-live.

## Establishing Ownership That Lasts

The solution isn't complicated, but it requires deliberate action:

First, name an owner. Not a committee, not a team — an individual accountable for outcomes.

Second, define what success looks like. Not in terms of features delivered or systems implemented, but in terms of business value created.

Third, establish governance that enables decisions. The owner needs authority to make trade-offs, allocate resources, and drive adoption.

Finally, connect ownership to the operating model. Digital products need sustained investment and attention. If ownership disappears when the project closes, so will value realisation.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Most organisations know this. They understand that ownership matters. They recognise that digital products need sustained attention.

Yet they continue to structure programmes as projects with end dates, assign ownership to committees, and wonder why adoption stalls and value fails to materialise.

The uncomfortable truth is that establishing real ownership requires changing how decisions are made, how success is measured, and how accountability is assigned. That's harder than buying another platform.

But it's the only thing that actually works.
