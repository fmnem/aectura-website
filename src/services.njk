        <h3>Digital Strategy & Transformation</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Defining digital direction for capital programmes and asset organisations. We help establish the vision, roadmap, and governance required to move from aspiration to execution.</p>
          <p>This includes digital maturity assessment, strategic roadmap development, business case development, and transformation programme design. The focus is always on alignment with business outcomes — not technology trends or vendor roadmaps.</p>

        <h3>Enterprise Digital Product Ownership</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Many organisations struggle with enterprise digital products — AIM platforms, Digital Twins, PMIS, analytics dashboards. They're procured without clear ownership, configured without strategy, and adopted without governance.</p>
          <p>We provide product ownership and strategy for enterprise platforms, helping define the product vision, establish ownership structures, drive adoption, and ensure these investments deliver sustained value beyond implementation.</p>

        <h3>Information Management</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Asset information is the foundation of digital value. Yet too many programmes treat information management as a compliance exercise rather than a strategic capability.</p>
          <p>We help organisations establish information management that works — aligned to ISO 19650 and ISO 55000 principles, but focused on practical outcomes. This includes BIM strategy and execution, asset information requirements, data governance, and handover strategy.</p>

        <h3>Decision Support & Analytics</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Dashboards proliferate. Insights remain scarce. The gap between data collection and decision support continues to widen.</p>
          <p>We help organisations establish analytics that inform action — executive reporting, performance dashboards, and decision support tools that connect to what leadership actually needs to know. This includes requirements definition, data strategy, and adoption support.</p>

        <h3>Embedded Digital Leadership</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Sometimes organisations need senior digital capability embedded within their teams — to drive delivery, provide assurance, or establish new functions.</p>
          <p>We provide experienced practitioners who can operate at pace within complex environments. This includes interim digital leadership, programme assurance, targeted delivery support, and capability building.</p>
