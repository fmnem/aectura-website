        <p class="about-lead">AECTURA operates at the intersection of strategy, enterprise digital products, asset information, and delivery. We help organisations turn digital investment into real, measurable outcomes.</p>
        <p>We don't sell software. We don't provide generic BIM services. Instead, we focus on what actually determines whether digital programmes succeed: clarity, ownership, integration, adoption, and value realisation across the full asset lifecycle.</p>
        <p>Our engagements are focused on defining the right problem, establishing accountability, aligning stakeholders, and ensuring digital initiatives are adopted and deliver value. The firm is deliberately small, senior, and focused — working in high-trust environments where credibility and experience matter.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Principles</h2>
    <div class="values-grid">
      <div class="value-item">
        <h3>Outcomes Over Outputs</h3>
        <p>We measure success by business value delivered — not by documents produced, systems implemented, or workshops facilitated. Digital initiatives must move the needle on what matters.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-item">
        <h3>Ownership is Everything</h3>
        <p>Digital programmes without clear ownership fail. We help establish accountability structures and ensure someone is responsible for value realisation beyond implementation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-item">
        <h3>Pragmatic Over Theoretical</h3>
        <p>Frameworks have their place, but defensible solutions that work in your context matter more. We focus on what's achievable, not what's ideal.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-item">
        <h3>Senior by Design</h3>
        <p>We don't operate a pyramid model. Engagements are delivered by experienced practitioners who've led digital programmes in complex environments.</p>
