    <span class="section-label">The Reality</span>
    <h2 class="section-title">Digital programmes are stalling</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
      <div>
        <p>Across infrastructure and the built environment, organisations have invested heavily in digital transformation. Yet many programmes remain stuck — fragmented tools, unclear ownership, and initiatives that generate activity without outcomes.</p>
        <p>The result is often a patchwork of tactical fixes: platforms procured without strategy, data collected without purpose, and dashboards that inform nobody.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>This isn't a technology problem. It's a clarity problem. Too many digital efforts lack defined ownership, measurable outcomes, and alignment with what the business actually needs.</p>
        <p>The gap between digital investment and digital value continues to widen — not because of missing tools, but because of missing intent.</p>

        <h3>Define the Right Problem</h3>
        <p>Before solutions, we establish what success looks like — aligning digital initiatives with business outcomes, not vendor roadmaps.</p>

        <h3>Establish Ownership</h3>
        <p>Digital programmes fail without clear accountability. We help establish ownership structures that survive beyond the project lifecycle.</p>
